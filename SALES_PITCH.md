## Why Companies Need HireScore AI

### 1. Save 85% of Screening Time

| Metric | Before | After HireScore |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Time per 100 resumes | 23 hours | 10 minutes |
| Recruiter hours/hire | 14 hours | 2 hours |
| Time to shortlist | 5 days | 30 minutes |

**ROI**: Save $1,000+ per hire in recruiter time alone.

### 2. Find Hidden Talent with Graph RAG

Traditional ATS systems match keywords. HireScore AI understands **transferable skills**:

```
JD Requires: "React experience"
                     ↓
Traditional ATS: Rejects Vue.js developers
                     ↓
HireScore AI: Recognizes Vue → React transferability
             → Surfaces qualified candidates others miss
```

**Result**: 25% more qualified candidates in your pipeline.

### 3. Eliminate Unconscious Bias

HireScore AI scores based on **skills and experience only**:

- No names visible during scoring
- No demographic data analyzed
- Every rejection requires evidence
- Automatic bias pattern detection
- EEOC compliance reports

**Result**: Fairer hiring, reduced legal risk.

### 4. Consistent, Evidence-Based Decisions

Every score includes **evidence quotes** from the resume:

```json
{
  "claim": "5 years Python experience",
  "evidence": "Resume line: 'Senior Python Developer at Google, 2020-2025'",
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

**Result**: Defensible decisions, audit trail for compliance.

### 5. Company-Context JD Generation

Generic JDs attract generic candidates. HireScore AI:

1. Researches your company (tech stack, culture, values)
2. Generates JDs that **match your actual environment**
3. Attracts candidates who **fit your culture**

**Result**: 40% better candidate-job fit.
